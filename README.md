# Landing Page Project

Simple Project for Practicing after learning (HTML, CSS, JS and The DOM)

## Table of Contents

CSS, Html, Javascript. I have searched many resources to get the necessarily knowladge in order to finish this project.

## Instructions

This Project was just a kick-start to navigate around the Page
it has not too many Functions but just basics:

# Creating Navigation Bar by JS

As Unordered List can take many lists as desired then this list will be added to The nav bar in the HTML while loading the Page.

# Navigate to Sections making The Section on the Screen Active.

Event Listener implemented to just determine the section currently on viewport, then set the animation class active.

# Scrolling to clicked Section:

this suppose to scroll the screen to the clicked Section but smoothly and comfortable way, so it would not hurt the Viewer's eyes

# Final Thought

This indeed was a humble and quite simple experience for a professional Developer, but for me was a real thing :) in terms to practice all what i heve passively learned.

thanks a lot for your reviewing. I am really grateful so far.
